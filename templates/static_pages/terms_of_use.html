<h1>Terms of Use</h1>

<p>Cobweb is currently hosted by the California Digital Library (CDL). As a platform to support collaborative and coordinated collection development of web archives, Cobweb is designed to both aggregate and solicit metadata about web archiving intentions, plans, and activities. Cobweb is a neutral content aggregator that only collects content that is freely and openly available on the Web and via open metadata exchange protocols. Content contributed to Cobweb will be done under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY) license. The Cobweb maintains attribution for all contributed material. If and when requests are made to disable access to content managed or displayed in the platform, they will meet a prompt response.</p> 

<p>Cobweb is intended to provide visibility into the collecting intentions, plans, and activities of organizations and individuals involved in web archiving. As such, platform users who establish Cobweb accounts in so doing agree to sharing their organizational affiliation(s) (if supplied) and to making their names available for inclusion as administrators on collaborative collecting projects or on organizational profiles.</p>  

<p>A note on accessibility: Cobweb is currently an experimental platform and as such is being built to be accessible via screen readers, keyword navigation, and mobile device. Some features may not meet these standards yet and we are working to update them as development continues.
